1. **Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project**  
A standard source control process is essential for managing code changes, collaboration with other developers and ensuring the stability of the project itself. Here's an overview of the source control process.  
A. **Version Control System Selection:**  
The first step is choosing a Version Control System.Git is a popular and widely used version control system. It offers distributed version control and it is recommended for its flexibility and perfomance.  
B. **Repository Setup:**  
Create a central repository that will serve as the single source of truth for the project. In the case pf Git, this would be a bare repository hosted on a remote serve, such as GitHub.  
C. **Branch Setup:**  
Next step is to create a branch. A common approach is the "Gitflow" workflow, which involves creating branches for features, releases and maintenance.  
D. **Developer Workflow:**  
Developers work on their local copies of the repository, creating feature branches off the main development branch(e.g "master"). They commit changes to their feature branches as they work.  
E. **Code Review:**  
Before merging the feature branches into the main development branch, code reviews are performed.Changes are reviwed to ensure code quality and identify potential issues.  
F. **Continuous Integration(CI):**  
Implement a CI system that automatically builds and tests code changes when new code is pushed to the repository. This ensures that the project remains in a stable state and prevents integartion problems.  
G. **Automated Testing:**  
Integrate automated testing, including unit tests, integration tetsts and other relevant tests. These tests are executed during the CI process, providing quick feedback on the code's functionality and reliability.  
H. **Pull Requests:**  
When a feature is ready for integration, developers create pull request to propose their changes. The pull request is reviewed by peers to validate the changes before merging.  
I. **Deployment:**  
A well defined deploment process ensures smooth and reliable releases.  
J. **Version Tagging:**  
For each release, version tags are created in the repository to mark specific points in the project's history. Version tags make it easy to identify and access specific releases.
